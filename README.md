# Suicide Detection LSTM Model

This project involves the development of a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for detecting suicidal ideation from text data. By analyzing language patterns and sentiment in written content, the model aims to provide an early warning system for identifying individuals at risk, aiding in mental health intervention.

## Features

- **LSTM Architecture**: 
  - Leverages the power of LSTMs to analyze sequential text data effectively.
- **Text Preprocessing**: 
  - Includes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal to prepare text for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: 
  - Incorporates features to assess emotional tone within the text.
- **High Accuracy**: 
  - Trained on a diverse dataset to ensure robust performance.
- **Real-World Application**: 
  - Designed for integration into chatbots, social media monitoring tools, and mental health platforms.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
  - Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for preprocessing and evaluation
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- **Dataset**: Open datasets containing suicidal and non-suicidal text samples (e.g., Reddit, Kaggle)


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- A machine with TensorFlow/Keras installed
- Recommended: GPU for faster training

---

## Dataset

The model is trained on a combination of publicly available datasets, including:

- Reddit forums containing posts labeled as suicidal or non-suicidal.
- Social media datasets sourced from Kaggle.
- Custom-curated samples to balance and diversify the dataset.

**Preprocessing steps**: 
- Remove punctuation and numbers.
- Lowercase text.
- Tokenize words and remove stopwords.
- Apply stemming/lemmatization.

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model consists of:

1. **Embedding Layer**: Converts text into dense vector representations.
2. **LSTM Layers**: Captures the temporal dependencies in text sequences.
3. **Dense Layers**: Processes LSTM outputs for classification.
4. **Output Layer**: Sigmoid activation for binary classification (suicidal or non-suicidal).

---

## Results

- **Accuracy**: ~90% on the test dataset.
- **Precision**: High precision to minimize false positives.
- **Recall**: Optimized recall to catch true positive cases.
- **F1 Score**: Balanced F1 score for overall model performance.

## Usage

### Integration

- Integrate the model into an application via an API.
- Use the model for real-time text analysis in chatbots or support systems.

### Example Input

```python
text = "I feel hopeless and don't see the point in living anymore."
prediction = model.predict(text)
print("Prediction:", "Suicidal" if prediction > 0.5 else "Non-Suicidal")
```
